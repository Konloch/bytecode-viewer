    /**
     * Encrypts a password in a crypt(3) compatible way.
     * <p>
     * The exact algorithm depends on the format of the salt string:
     * <ul>
     * <li>SHA-512 salts start with {@code $6$} and are up to 16 chars long.
     * <li>SHA-256 salts start with {@code $5$} and are up to 16 chars long
     * <li>MD5 salts start with {@code $1$} and are up to 8 chars long
     * <li>DES, the traditional UnixCrypt algorithm is used with only 2 chars
     * <li>Only the first 8 chars of the passwords are used in the DES algorithm!
     * </ul>
     * The magic strings {@code "$apr1$"} and {@code "$2a$"} are not recognized by this method as its output should be
     * identical with that of the libc implementation.
     * <p>
     * The rest of the salt string is drawn from the set {@code [a-zA-Z0-9./]} and is cut at the maximum length of if a
     * {@code "$"} sign is encountered. It is therefore valid to enter a complete hash value as salt to e.g. verify a
     * password with:
     *
     * <pre>
     * storedPwd.equals(crypt(enteredPwd, storedPwd))
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The resulting string starts with the marker string ({@code $6$}), continues with the salt value and ends with a
     * {@code "$"} sign followed by the actual hash value. For DES the string only contains the salt and actual hash.
     * It's total length is dependent on the algorithm used:
     * <ul>
     * <li>SHA-512: 106 chars
     * <li>SHA-256: 63 chars
     * <li>MD5: 34 chars
     * <li>DES: 13 chars
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Example:
     *
     * <pre>
     *      crypt("secret", "$1$xxxx") =&gt; "$1$xxxx$aMkevjfEIpa35Bh3G4bAc."
     *      crypt("secret", "xx") =&gt; "xxWAum7tHdIUw"
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * This method comes in a variation that accepts a byte[] array to support input strings that are not encoded in
     * UTF-8 but e.g. in ISO-8859-1 where equal characters result in different byte values.
     *
     * @see "The man page of the libc crypt (3) function."
     * @param key
     *            plaintext password as entered by the used
     * @param salt
     *            salt value
     * @return hash value, i.e. encrypted password including the salt string
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *             if the salt does not match the allowed pattern
     * @throws RuntimeException
     *             when a {@link java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException} is caught. *
