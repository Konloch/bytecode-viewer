import java.io.OutputStream;

/**
 * Provides Base64 encoding and decoding in a streaming fashion (unlimited size). When encoding the default lineLength
 * is 76 characters and the default lineEnding is CRLF, but these can be overridden by using the appropriate
 * constructor.
 * <p>
 * The default behaviour of the Base64OutputStream is to ENCODE, whereas the default behaviour of the Base64InputStream
 * is to DECODE. But this behaviour can be overridden by using a different constructor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class implements section <cite>6.8. Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding</cite> from RFC 2045 <cite>Multipurpose
 * Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies</cite> by Freed and Borenstein.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since this class operates directly on byte streams, and not character streams, it is hard-coded to only encode/decode
 * character encodings which are compatible with the lower 127 ASCII chart (ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, UTF-8, etc).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> It is mandatory to close the stream after the last byte has been written to it, otherwise the
 * final padding will be omitted and the resulting data will be incomplete/inconsistent.
 * </p>
