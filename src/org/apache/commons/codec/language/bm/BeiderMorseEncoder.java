/**
 * Encodes strings into their Beider-Morse phonetic encoding.
 * <p>
 * Beider-Morse phonetic encodings are optimised for family names. However, they may be useful for a wide range of
 * words.
 * <p>
 * This encoder is intentionally mutable to allow dynamic configuration through bean properties. As such, it is mutable,
 * and may not be thread-safe. If you require a guaranteed thread-safe encoding then use {@link PhoneticEngine}
 * directly.
 * <p>
 * <b>Encoding overview</b>
 * <p>
 * Beider-Morse phonetic encodings is a multi-step process. Firstly, a table of rules is consulted to guess what
 * language the word comes from. For example, if it ends in "<code>ault</code>" then it infers that the word is French.
 * Next, the word is translated into a phonetic representation using a language-specific phonetics table. Some runs of
 * letters can be pronounced in multiple ways, and a single run of letters may be potentially broken up into phonemes at
 * different places, so this stage results in a set of possible language-specific phonetic representations. Lastly, this
 * language-specific phonetic representation is processed by a table of rules that re-writes it phonetically taking into
 * account systematic pronunciation differences between languages, to move it towards a pan-indo-european phonetic
 * representation. Again, sometimes there are multiple ways this could be done and sometimes things that can be
 * pronounced in several ways in the source language have only one way to represent them in this average phonetic
 * language, so the result is again a set of phonetic spellings.
 * <p>
 * Some names are treated as having multiple parts. This can be due to two things. Firstly, they may be hyphenated. In
 * this case, each individual hyphenated word is encoded, and then these are combined end-to-end for the final encoding.
 * Secondly, some names have standard prefixes, for example, "<code>Mac/Mc</code>" in Scottish (English) names. As
 * sometimes it is ambiguous whether the prefix is intended or is an accident of the spelling, the word is encoded once
 * with the prefix and once without it. The resulting encoding contains one and then the other result.
 * <p>
 * <b>Encoding format</b>
 * <p>
 * Individual phonetic spellings of an input word are represented in upper- and lower-case roman characters. Where there
 * are multiple possible phonetic representations, these are joined with a pipe (<code>|</code>) character. If multiple
 * hyphenated words where found, or if the word may contain a name prefix, each encoded word is placed in elipses and
 * these blocks are then joined with hyphens. For example, "<code>d'ortley</code>" has a possible prefix. The form
 * without prefix encodes to "<code>ortlaj|ortlej</code>", while the form with prefix encodes to "
 * <code>dortlaj|dortlej</code>". Thus, the full, combined encoding is "<code>(ortlaj|ortlej)-(dortlaj|dortlej)</code>".
 * <p>
 * The encoded forms are often quite a bit longer than the input strings. This is because a single input may have many
 * potential phonetic interpretations. For example, "<code>Renault</code>" encodes to "
 * <code>rYnDlt|rYnalt|rYnult|rinDlt|rinalt|rinult</code>". The <code>APPROX</code> rules will tend to produce larger
 * encodings as they consider a wider range of possible, approximate phonetic interpretations of the original word.
 * Down-stream applications may wish to further process the encoding for indexing or lookup purposes, for example, by
 * splitting on pipe (<code>|</code>) and indexing under each of these alternatives.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>: this version of the Beider-Morse encoding is equivalent with v3.4 of the reference implementation.
