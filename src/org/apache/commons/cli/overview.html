<p>Commons CLI -- version 1.3</p>

<p>The commons-cli package aides in parsing command-line arguments.</p>

<p>Allow command-line arguments to be parsed against a descriptor of
    valid options (long and short), potentially with arguments.</p>

<p>command-line arguments may be of the typical <code>String[]</code>
    form, but also may be a <code>java.util.List</code>. Indexes allow
    for parsing only a portion of the command-line. Also, functionality
    for parsing the command-line in phases is built in, allowing for
    'cvs-style' command-lines, where some global options are specified
    before a 'command' argument, and command-specific options are
    specified after the command argument:

    <code>
    <pre>
        myApp -p &lt;port&gt; command -p &lt;printer&gt;
    </pre>
    </code>
