/**
 * Represents a JSON object, a set of name/value pairs, where the names are strings and the values
 * are JSON values.
 * <p>
 * Members can be added using the <code>add(String, ...)</code> methods which accept instances of
 * {@link JsonValue}, strings, primitive numbers, and boolean values. To modify certain values of an
 * object, use the <code>set(String, ...)</code> methods. Please note that the <code>add</code>
 * methods are faster than <code>set</code> as they do not search for existing members. On the other
 * hand, the <code>add</code> methods do not prevent adding multiple members with the same name.
 * Duplicate names are discouraged but not prohibited by JSON.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Members can be accessed by their name using {@link #get(String)}. A list of all names can be
 * obtained from the method {@link #names()}. This class also supports iterating over the members in
 * document order using an {@link #iterator()} or an enhanced for loop:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * for (Member member : jsonObject) {
 *   String name = member.getName();
 *   JsonValue value = member.getValue();
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Even though JSON objects are unordered by definition, instances of this class preserve the order
 * of members to allow processing in document order and to guarantee a predictable output.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is <strong>not thread-safe</strong>. If multiple threads access a
 * <code>JsonObject</code> instance concurrently, while at least one of these threads modifies the
 * contents of this object, access to the instance must be synchronized externally. Failure to do so
 * may lead to an inconsistent state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is <strong>not supposed to be extended</strong> by clients.
 * </p>
