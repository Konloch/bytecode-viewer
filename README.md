## What is Bytecode Viewer?
Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is an Advanced Lightweight Java/Android Reverse Engineering Suite. Powered by several open source tools BCV is designed to aid in the reversing process.

BCV comes with 6 decompilers, 3 disassemblers, 2 assemblers, 2 APK converters, advanced searching, debugging & more.

It's written completely in Java, and it's open sourced. It's currently being maintained and developed by Konloch.

## Is there a demo?
[![BCV Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/I5GT6PoTGOw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5GT6PoTGOw)

Please note this demo is from a very old version

## How do I install BCV?
Download the latest version from https://github.com/konloch/bytecode-viewer/releases and run the Bytecode-Viewer-2.10.x.jar.
You may need to execute it via command line ```java -jar Bytecode-Viewer-2.10.x.jar``` (replace the X with the current minor version)

## How can I use BCV?
* Starting with a Jar, Zip, ClassFile or Android file (APK, DEX, XAPK, etc) drag it into BCV. It will start the decoding process automatically.
* From here you can select the decompilers you would like to use by selecting the View Pane>View 1, View 2, View 3, etc.
* The view panes are-used to display up to 3 decompilers side by side, you can also toggle edibility here.
* Select the resource you would like to open by navigating using the resource list, BCV will do its best to display it (Decompiling, Disassembling, etc).
* You can use plugins to help you search along with using the search pane in the left-hand bottom corner.

## How do the plugins work?
There is also a plugin system that will allow you to interact with the loaded classfiles. You could for example write a String deobfuscator, a malicious code searcher, or anything else you can think of.

You can either use one of the pre-written plugins, or write your own. The plugin system supports java and javascript scripting.

Once a plugin is activated, it will execute the plugin with a ClassNode ArrayList of every single class loaded in BCV, this allows the user to handle it completely using ASM.

## Instructions to compile

Just clone this repo and run ``./mvnw package``. It's that simple!

## Working on the source

Open the Maven project (e.g. in IntelliJ, open the ``pom.xml`` as a project file).

## Java Heap Space Issues (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError)
Start BCV with more RAM, e.g. `java -Xmx3G -jar BCV.jar`

## File Permission Issues (java.io.FileNotFoundException)
Right click on the jar file, go to Properties, and select Unblock under Security at the bottom of the General tab.

## APK File Permission Issues (java.io.FileNotFoundException)
Run BCV as administrator.
