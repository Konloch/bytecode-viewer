Bytecode Viewer is an Advanced Lightweight Java Bytecode Viewer, GUI Procyon Java Decompiler, GUI CFR Java Decompiler, GUI FernFlower Java Decompiler, GUI Jar-Jar, Hex Viewer, Code Searcher, Debugger and more.
It's written completely in Java, and it's open sourced. It's currently being maintained and developed by Konloch.

There is also a plugin system that will allow you to interact with the loaded classfiles, for example you can write a String deobfuscator, a malicious code searcher, or something else you can think of.
You can either use one of the pre-written plugins, or write your own. It supports groovy, python and ruby scripting. Once a plugin is activated, it will send a ClassNode ArrayList of every single class loaded in the file system to the execute function, this allows the user to handle it completely using ASM.

Code from various projects has been used, including but not limited to:
J-RET by WaterWolf
JHexPane by Sam Koivu
JSynaxPane by Ayman Al
Commons IO by Apache
ASM by OW2
FernFlower by Stiver
Procyon by Mstrobel
CFR by Lee Benfield
